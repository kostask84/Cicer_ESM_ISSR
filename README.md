A repository containing data and code for the paper published in AoB Plants.  
    
## Data  
Environmental data are available from [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/version1), the [SoilGrids database](https://www.soilgrids.org/#!/?lon=23.8200669&lat=38.0238274&zoom=7&layer=TAXNWRB_250m&vector=1&showInfo=1) and the [envirem r package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/envirem/index.html).   
  
The coordinates of *Cicer graecum* are available upon request from the first author, since it constitutes a very rare Greek endemic taxon.
